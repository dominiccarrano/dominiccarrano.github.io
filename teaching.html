<p>One of the best things about UC Berkeley is its vibrant teaching community, which I'm grateful to be a part of. I'm currently serving as the head TA (or, in Berkeley lingo, GSI) for <a href="https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~eecs127/fa20/">EECS 127, Optimization Models in Engineering</a>. This fall is my fifth semester as a TA at Berkeley, and my fourth as a head TA.</p> I was a recipient of both the <a href="https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Students/Awards/13/">EECS Distinguished GSI Award</a>, and the Berkeley campus <a href="https://gsi.berkeley.edu/programs-services/award-programs/ogsi/ogsi-2020/">Outstanding GSI Award</a> for 2019-2020.

During my three semesters as the head TA for our Signals and Systems course, I spearheaded a project to bring a full set of 10 Jupyter Notebook virtual labs to the class. I'm grateful to have worked with a fantastic staff to create and continually refine the labs thanks to all our student feedback. I presented about the labs' design principles at the 2020 International Conference on Higher Education Advances, and the paper is available <strong><a href="./files/SelfContainedJupyterNotebookLabs.pdf">here</a></strong>. The labs are publicly available on GitHub <strong><a id="lab_link" href="â€‹https://github.com/dominiccarrano/ee-120-labs">here</a></strong>.

After four incredibly rewarding semesters of teaching Signals and Systems, I made the jump to EECS 127, Berkeley's course in convex optimization. I'm excited to be Head TA again and take on the new challenge of managing a larger course (~300 students) and larger course staff (a team of 16) this fall!
