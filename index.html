          <p>Hi there! I'm Dominic. I'm a 3rd year undergraduate at UC Berkeley studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. I'm interested in signal processing, statistical signal processing, machine learning, distributed systems, and serverless computing. I'm also very passionate about teaching and currently serving as the Head TA for EE 120, UC Berkeley's Signals and Systems class. Want to get in touch? Shoot me an email at <a href="mailto:carrano.dominic@gmail.com">carrano.dominic@gmail.com</a> or check out <a href="./resume.pdf">my resume</a>.

          <h3>Teaching</h3>
          A lot of my time at school is spent teaching, and I wouldn't have it any other way. I've found it to be very fulfilling, and it's also helped me learn the material on a much deeper level. My teaching experiences have been an invaluable part of my education. I'm involved in teaching at Berkeley in two main capacities: 
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Head TA for EE 120, UC Berkeley's Signals and Systems class.</strong> EE 120 is typically the first upper division electrical engineering class students take. It covers linear system theory, Fourier analysis, and some sampling and control theory. I've served as an EE 120 TA for two semesters now (Fall 2018, Spring 2019). 
            <br>
            One of the best things about being a TA is how much impact I'm able to have on improving the class. This semester, as head TA, I'm leading several course development efforts:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>iPython Labs.</strong> EE 120 is a fairly theoretical class aimed at giving students a lot of the mathematical foundations needed for electrical engineering. Applications of the content have traditionally been left to future classes. As a result, the material can often seem disconnected from the real world. To help bridge this gap, I'm working, along with a fantastic team of TAs, on developing iPython notebook labs to supplement the material. The labs cover Scientific Computing in Python (numpy, matplotlib, iPython notebook), Convolution and Filtering, The Fast Fourier Transform, 1D Signal and 2D Image Deconvolution, Orthogonal Signaling, and PID Control. I'm very excited to add this hands-on component to the class this semester, and grateful for my fellow staff members' help in making this happen.</li>
              <li><strong>Discussion Section Worksheets.</strong> Berkeley courses typically consist of lectures from the professor, followed by TA-led discussion sections to do practice problems on the content. In Fall 2018, we created a brand new set of  worksheets + solutions for these discussion sections for the students. Before we created these, none existed for the class. This semester, we're iterating on that first set of worksheets to give students an even better resource.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>EE 16A Coordinator for <a href="https://csmberkeley.github.io/#/">Computer Science Mentors (CSM).</a></strong> CSM is a club at UC Berkeley that offers auxiliary tutoring sections of 4-6 students for all of Berkeley's lower division EECS courses. This allows students to have a more personalized learning experience in classes that have enrollments of 1000+ students each semester, and has helped the department's classes scale with the massive surge in demand of the past few years. I've been involved in CSM for three semesters now, all with EE 16A, the introductory electrical engineering class for freshmen. As a mentor, I have taught EE 16A sections on topics including linear algebra, circuit theory, and optimization. As EE 16A Coordinator, I have the additional responsibilities of interviewing and selecting new mentors from our applicant pool and overseeing all of CSM's EE 16A operations (printing worksheets, booking rooms for sections, managing all 30+ mentors), all of which are shared responsibilities with a Co-Coordinator.
            <br>
            </li>
          </ol>
          
          A copy of my teaching reviews (as both a TA and a CS Mentor) are available upon request.

          <h3>Classes</h3>
          My interests are pretty diverse (maybe I just have a short attention span?), and I could easily spend 6-7 years taking all the classes Berkeley has that interest me. That said, I'm trying to make the most of the 4 years I have, and here's a list of all the classes I've taken so far:

          <ul>
            <li>EE 16A/B: Designing Information Devices and Systems I and II</li>
            <li>EE 120: Signals and Systems</li>
            <li>EE 123: Digital Signal Processing</li>
            <li>EE 126: Probability and Random Processes</li>
            <li>EE 127: Optimization Models in Engineering</li>
            <li>CS 61A: The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</li>
            <li>CS 61B: Data Structures</li>
            <li>CS 61C: Computer Architecture</li>
            <li>CS 70: Discrete Math and Probability Theory</li>
            <li>CS 162: Operating Systems and Systems Programming</li>
            <li>CS 170: Efficient Algorithms and Intractable Problems</li>
            <li>Math 53: Multivariable Calculus</li>
            <li>Math 54: Linear Algebra and Differential Equations</li>
            <li>Math 110: Advanced Linear Algebra</li>
            <li>Physics 7A: Mechanics and Wave Motion</li>
            <li>Physics 7B: Thermodynamics and Electromagnetism</li>
          </ul>

          Outside of all things academic and teaching-related I do at UC Berkeley, there's a few different things I spend my time on:

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Internships!</strong> I've been very fortunate to have interned at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in my hometown of Livermore, California the past 4 summers, learning from some fantastic mentors. I spent my first 3 summers there (2015/16/17) in a computer security focused program called Cyber Defenders, where I also created and taught a class on Python programming. More recently (2018), as my interests shifted toward signal processing, I got a chance to work within the Lab at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) on the problem of generating error bounds for deconvolution algorithms.</li>
            <li><strong>Soccer!</strong> I've been playing soccer since I was two years old, and still play intramural soccer at Berkeley for fun. I also love watching soccer -   root for the US Men's and Women's National Teams, as well as whatever team Cristiano Ronaldo's on (so much for that Real Madrid flag I have!).</li>
          </ul>
