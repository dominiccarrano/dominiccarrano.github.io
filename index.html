          <p>Hi there! I'm Dominic. I'm a 3rd year undergraduate at UC Berkeley studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS). My primary interests are in signal processing, statistical signal processing, machine learning, distributed systems, and serverless computing. I'm also very passionate about <a href="./teaching.html">teaching</a>, which I've been involved with in some capacity since high school, currently serving as the Head TA for EE 120, UC Berkeley's Signals and Systems class. Want to get in touch? Feel free to connect with me on any of the platforms below!

          <h3>Teaching</h3>
          My time at school is invovles a lot of teaching, and I wouldn't have it any other way. I'm involved in teaching in two capacities: 
          <ol>
            <li>I'm head TA for EE 120, UC Berkeley's Signals and Systems class. EE 120 is typically the first upper division electrical engineering class students take. It covers linear system theory, Fourier analysis, and sampling theory. I've served on the course staff for two semesters now, one as a TA (Fall 2018) and one as head TA (Spring 2019). One of the best things about being a TA is how much impact I'm able to have on developing the course. This semester, as head TA, I'm leading a several efforts to develop the class:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>iPython Labs.</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Discussion Worksheets.</strong></li>
              <li><strong>A Class Website.</strong></li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>I'm also the EE 16A Co-Coordinator for <a href="https://csmberkeley.github.io/#/">Computer Science Mentors (CSM).</a> CSM is a club at UC Berkeley that offers auxiliary tutoring sections of 4-6 students for all of Berkeley's lower division EECS courses, helping students have a more personalized learning experience in classes that typically have enrollments of 1000+ students each semester. I've been involved in CSM's EE 16A activities for three semesters now, teaching EE 16A sections on topics including linear algebra, circuit theory, and optimization, in addition to helping manage and lead other mentors through some of my more recent roles as Co-Coordinator (Spring 2019) and Senior Mentor (Fall 2018).</li>
          </ol>
          
          <br>
          <h3>Classes</h3>
          My interests are pretty diverse (maybe I just have a short attention span?), and honestly, it would take me about 7-8 years to take all the classes Berkeley has to offer that interest me. That said, I'm trying to make the most of the 4 years I have, and here's a list of all the classes I've taken so far:

          <ul>
            <li>EE 16A/B: Designing Information Devices and Systems I and II</li>
            <li>EE 120: Signals and Systems</li>
            <li>EE 123: Digital Signal Processing</li>
            <li>EE 126: Probability and Random Processes</li>
            <li>EE 127: Optimization Models in Engineering</li>
            <li>CS 61A: The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</li>
            <li>CS 61B: Data Structures</li>
            <li>CS 61C: Computer Architecture</li>
            <li>CS 70: Discrete Math and Probability Theory</li>
            <li>CS 162: Operating Systems and Systems Programming</li>
            <li>CS 170: Efficient Algorithms and Intractable Problems</li>
            <li>Math 53: Multivariable Calculus</li>
            <li>Math 54: Linear Algebra and Differential Equations</li>
            <li>Math 110: Advanced Linear Algebra</li>
            <li>Physics 7A: Mechanics and Wave Motion</li>
            <li>Physics 7B: Thermodynamics and Electromagnetism</li>
          </ul>

          Outside of all things academic and teaching-related I do at UC Berkeley, there's a few different things I spend my time on:

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Internships!</strong> I've been very fortunate to have interned at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in my hometown of Livermore, California the past 4 summers, learning from some fantastic mentors. I spent my first 3 summers there (2015/16/17) in a computer security focused program called Cyber Defenders, where I also created and taught a class on Python programming. More recently (2018), as my interests shifted toward signal processing, I got a chance to work within the Lab at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) on the problem of generating error bounds for deconvolution algorithms.</li>
            <li><strong>Soccer!</strong> I've been playing soccer since I was two years old, and still play in Berkeley's intramural leagues today. I also love watching soccer, and I root for the US Men's and Women's National Teams, as well as whatever team Cristiano Ronaldo's on (so much for that Real Madrid flag I have!).</li>
          </ul>
